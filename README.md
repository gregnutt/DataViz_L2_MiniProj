WTF Visualizations Post: http://viz.wtf/post/129506158820/fact#notes

This graphic suffers from a few problems.  Primarily, to my eye, is the lenseflare in the center of the pie chart.  This chartjunk is extremely distracting from the main information that the graphic is trying to display: % energy consumption by appliance, particularly through Water Heating.  The colors and 3D shadow effect are also bright and unnecessary to the goal of the visualization.

I believe this chart could be easily simplified by removing all colors, except for a muted color for Water Heating to draw the attention to that slice, and removing the shadow effect.
